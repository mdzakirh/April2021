To contaion an abstract method Class should be an abstract class
An abstract class can contain abstract methods and non abstract methods
Abstract only contain the unimplemented abstruct methods

Interface - another way to do the abstraction in java

public void sample(){
ints fafafa;
asdf;
}

public void sample2();


1. between the abstract class and interface, interface is more secure
2. you can create an object of an abstract class, but not for interface
3. in inteface you have implement all the methods of interface
4. interface methods do not have any body or implmentation
